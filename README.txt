# Chatbot-built-on-ollama
I built this simplae chatbot based on ollama pretty neat heres a summerized descirption:
The Outline: In this lab we successfully created a chatbot with a memory using ollama models that can use a /exit command to end the session, a /model command to switch models, and a /new command to clear the chatbot's memory. We use a query function that returns a string and also streams the response of the model to the console. The chatbot also creates transcript files for each session that relay the info transferred between user and computer. Other variables we used were a MODEL variable which was helpful to use when implementing the /model function as it only takes about three lines of code to implement this way. There was also the variable labeled x, j, and PROMPT. X was essentially the transcript we fed back into the model in order to get the model to remember prior responses. J was the most recent message given by the bot that let us easily relay the message and save transcripts properly. PROMPT was helpful for checking user commands, but also to relay to the model the most recent thing the user said on top of the prior conversation. We then threw a few conditionals in there to figure out when commands are being called and we got ourselves a working chatbot. Another aspect of implementing the /model command was using the split() function to first check if the command was being called then just changing MODEL to words[2] assuming words == PROMPT.split(). The streaming element was also unique, but it was mostly looking at the documentation on Github then creating a new variable named final which I then set equal to all the chunks combined so the transcript would not get messed up.

	Struggles: I couldn’t for the life of me get making subfolders to work. I tried using the os library which was recommended to me by my chat bot, but still struggled to make it work without errors. I also was seemingly missing permissions to do so for some reason. 

	Acknowledgements: Tenghoit Kouch helped me figure out what the streaming part 
meant, The Ollama Github directory for giving some helpful examples of functions, Dr. Allen of Centre College for teaching the premise of how it’s supposed to work, and my chat bot for helping me delude some of the rust off my python.
